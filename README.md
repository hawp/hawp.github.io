# WordPress Hosting Standards

## Principle
HAWP, short for High-availability WordPress, envisions an open community for WordPress hosting, with a better environment for data portability and a better definition for data ownership. 

## What is it about?

In the WordPress ecosystem, hosting is a walled-garden, which invades the founding principles of an open platform. We want to change that.
HAWP proposes two guidelines:  

  1. __Data Portability__
  
     We want to propose a set of rules in how data is processed in order to make it easier to migrate from one provider to another.

  2. __Data Ownership__
  
     We want to give the site owner the whole picture of his data, and make it easier to access and download it.
